# Cmac
Cerebellar Model Articulation with local weighted regression

### Description
This is an implementation of Cmac with local weighed regression trained over 70 sampled points  and tested with 30 points in the range [0,10]. Refer to report for a detailed description on how this is achieved.

### Run Code
